### **OneLake Architecture**
```
OneLake (Tenant Level)
├── Workspace A
│   ├── Lakehouse 1
│   │   ├── Files/ (Unstructured data)
│   │   └── Tables/ (Delta tables)
│   └── Lakehouse 2
├── Workspace B
│   └── Lakehouse 3
└── Workspace C
    └── Data Warehouse
```

### **Key OneLake Features**
- **Shortcuts**: Create virtual connections to external data without copying
- **Delta Lake Format**: ACID transactions, time travel, and schema evolution
- **Automatic Discovery**: Data catalog and lineage tracking built-in
- **Cross-Workspace Access**: Share data securely across organizational boundaries

## Lakehouse Fundamentals

A **Lakehouse** in Microsoft Fabric combines the best features of data lakes and data warehouses:

### **Lakehouse = Data Lake + Data Warehouse**
- **Flexibility of Data Lakes**: Store any data format at any scale
- **Performance of Data Warehouses**: SQL query performance and ACID transactions
- **Open Format**: Based on Delta Lake for vendor independence
- **Unified Analytics**: Single platform for batch and real-time processing

### **Lakehouse Structure**
Every Lakehouse contains two main areas:
1. **Files Section**: For unstructured data (JSON, CSV, images, etc.)
2. **Tables Section**: For structured Delta tables with schema enforcement

## Prerequisites

Before creating your Lakehouse, ensure you have:
- Microsoft Fabric workspace access
- Contributor or Admin role in the workspace
- Fabric capacity assigned to your workspace
- Data Engineering experience enabled

## Step-by-Step Lakehouse Creation

### Step 1: Access Your Fabric Workspace

1. **Navigate to Microsoft Fabric**
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to [https://fabric.microsoft.com](https://fabric.microsoft.com)
   - Sign in with your organizational credentials

2. **Select Your Workspace**
   - Choose the workspace where you want to create the Lakehouse
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions (Contributor or Admin)

### Step 2: Switch to Data Engineering Experience

3. **Change Experience**
   - Look for the experience selector in the bottom-left corner
   - Click on it and select **Data Engineering**
   - This will show you the tools and options specific to data engineering workloads

### Step 3: Create the Lakehouse

4. **Initiate Lakehouse Creation**
   - Click the **+ New** button in the workspace
   - From the dropdown menu, select **Lakehouse**

5. **Configure Lakehouse Settings**
   - **Name**: Enter `lh_uber_eats`
   - **Description** (optional): "UberEats analytics data lakehouse for workshop"
   - Click **Create**

### Step 4: Enable Public Schema Preview

6. **Access Lakehouse Settings**
   - Once the Lakehouse is created, you'll be redirected to the Lakehouse explorer
   - Look for the **Settings** icon (⚙️) in the top toolbar
   - Click on **Settings**

7. **Enable Public Schema Preview**
   - In the settings panel, locate **"Public schema preview"**
   - Toggle the switch to **ON** ✅
   - This enables SQL endpoint access for analytics tools
   - Click **Apply** or **Save**

### Step 5: Verify Lakehouse Creation

8. **Explore Your New Lakehouse**
   - You should now see the Lakehouse interface with two main sections:
     - **Files**: For unstructured data storage
     - **Tables**: For Delta table management
   - The Lakehouse should appear in your workspace items list

9. **Confirm SQL Endpoint**
   - Navigate back to your workspace
   - You should see two new items:
     - `lh_uber_eats` (Lakehouse)
     - `lh_uber_eats` (SQL endpoint) - automatically created
   - This confirms the public schema preview is working correctly

## Understanding Your Lakehouse Structure

### **File System Organization**
```
lh_uber_eats/
├── Files/
│   ├── bronze/          # Raw data from source systems
│   ├── silver/          # Cleaned and transformed data
│   ├── gold/            # Business-ready aggregated data
│   └── external/        # Shortcuts to external data sources
└── Tables/
    ├── bronze_drivers   # Delta tables for raw driver data
    ├── silver_orders    # Processed order information
    └── gold_analytics   # Business metrics and KPIs
```

### **Access Methods**
Your Lakehouse can be accessed through multiple interfaces:
- **Lakehouse Explorer**: Visual file and table management
- **SQL Endpoint**: Query tables using T-SQL
- **Spark Notebooks**: Programmatic access with Python/Scala
- **Power BI**: Direct connectivity for reporting
- **APIs**: REST endpoints for external applications

## Validation Checklist

Confirm your environment is ready:
- Lakehouse `lh_uber_eats` created successfully
- Public schema preview enabled
- SQL endpoint automatically generated
- Files and Tables sections visible
- Lakehouse appears in workspace items
- You can navigate between Lakehouse and SQL endpoint views

## Next Steps

With your Lakehouse environment ready, you can now proceed to:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Load data using DataFlow Gen2, Shortcuts, or Pipelines
2. **Data Transformation**: Process data through the medallion architecture
3. **Analytics**: Create semantic models and Power BI reports
4. **Data Science**: Build and deploy machine learning models

Your `lh_uber_eats` Lakehouse is now ready to serve as the foundation for your data engineering and analytics workflows!

## Best Practices

### **Naming Conventions**
- Use consistent prefixes: `lh_` for Lakehouses
- Include purpose in names: `lh_uber_eats` indicates the domain
- Avoid spaces and special characters

### **Security Considerations**
- Implement workspace-level access controls
- Use Entra ID groups for permission management
- Enable audit logging for compliance requirements

### **Performance Optimization**
- Organize data in medallion layers (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- Use appropriate partitioning strategies for large datasets
- Leverage Delta Lake features like optimization and vacuum
