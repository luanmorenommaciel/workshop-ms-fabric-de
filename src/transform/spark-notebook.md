# Bronze to Silver Transformation - Medallion Architecture

This document outlines the systematic approach for transforming Bronze layer data into clean, validated Silver layer data using Microsoft Fabric and Apache Spark.

## Overview

The Bronze to Silver transformation follows the medallion architecture pattern, applying data quality techniques while maintaining data granularity. No aggregations are performed at this stage - all transformations preserve the original row-level detail.

## Transformation Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Data Loading
**Objective**: Load bronze tables and verify data availability

- Initialize Spark session and import required libraries
- Load all bronze tables from the lakehouse
- Perform initial row count verification
- Validate data accessibility across all bronze sources

### Phase 2: Data Quality Assessment and Schema Analysis  
**Objective**: Analyze schemas and identify data quality issues

- Examine schema structure for each bronze table
- Perform comprehensive null count analysis
- Identify data type inconsistencies
- Preview sample data to understand content patterns
- Document data quality baseline metrics

### Phase 3: Data Cleansing and Standardization
**Objective**: Clean and standardize each bronze table while maintaining the same granularity (no aggregations)

- Apply string cleaning (trim, proper case formatting)
- Standardize data types and formats
- Clean phone numbers and extract digits only
- Normalize categorical values (vehicle types, etc.)
- Convert timestamps to proper datetime formats
- Create derived time-based columns (hour, day period)

### Phase 4: Data Verification and Validation
**Objective**: Verify data integrity and apply business rule validations while maintaining granularity

- Implement comprehensive data verification rules
- Apply business logic validations (valid IDs, positive amounts, etc.)
- Add validation flags to track data quality at row level
- Generate data quality scorecards
- Identify and flag invalid records without removing them

### Phase 5: Data Conformance and Standardization
**Objective**: Conform data to standard formats and create unified schemas across all tables

- Standardize datetime columns across all tables
- Add consistent metadata columns (data_source, created_at, updated_at)
- Apply uniform quality scoring methodology
- Create business categorizations (value categories, status groupings)
- Ensure schema consistency across related tables

### Phase 6: Data Enrichment and Business Logic
**Objective**: Add calculated fields and business logic to enhance data value without creating relationships

- Add business categorizations and classifications
- Create temporal enrichments (day of week, business hours, seasonality)
- Apply domain-specific logic (delivery urgency, experience levels)
- Add profile completeness indicators
- Generate formatted display fields

### Phase 7: Data Munging and Final Silver Preparation
**Objective**: Apply final transformations and prepare optimized Silver tables with consistent schema

- Select and rename columns for final silver schema
- Apply consistent column ordering and naming conventions
- Add silver-layer specific metadata (load timestamps, record hashes)
- Perform final data type optimizations
- Validate final schema consistency

### Phase 8: Write Silver Tables to Lakehouse
**Objective**: Persist cleaned Silver tables to the Silver layer with proper Delta Lake optimization

- Write tables to silver schema with Delta Lake format
- Apply Delta Lake optimizations (OPTIMIZE, VACUUM)
- Verify successful table creation and row counts
- Perform final data validation checks
- Generate silver layer statistics and quality metrics

## Key Principles

### Data Quality Techniques Applied
- **Clean**: Standardize formats, remove special characters, apply proper casing
- **Verify**: Add validation rules and quality scoring
- **Conform**: Standardize schemas and create unified data formats
- **Match**: Establish data consistency without creating joins
- **Munge**: Apply final transformations and prepare optimized schemas

### Best Practices Followed
- **Granularity Preservation**: No aggregations or data loss during transformation
- **Quality Tracking**: Each record tagged with validation flags and quality scores
- **Schema Consistency**: Unified approach to column naming and data types
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Added business context and calculated fields
- **Delta Lake Optimization**: Leveraged Delta format for ACID properties and performance

## Output

The transformation produces three optimized Silver tables:
- `lh_uber_eats.dbo.silver_drivers` - Clean driver information with enriched attributes
- `lh_uber_eats.dbo.silver_orders` - Validated order data with temporal enrichments  
- `lh_uber_eats.dbo.silver_status` - Standardized status updates with business categorizations

All Silver tables maintain the same granularity as Bronze while providing clean, validated, and enriched data ready for Gold layer dimensional modeling.
